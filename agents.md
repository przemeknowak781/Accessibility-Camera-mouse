1. Ensure you use the optimal technology stack and libraries. Always look for the  practices, versions and updates.
2. Keep files short, below 900 lines of code. Modularize the code into smaller, reusable components. Document the code structure. 
3. Make sure that connections between components are properly implemented and tested.
4. Look for optimization and simplification opportunities, but never at the cost of functionality, maintainability and performance
5. Hunt down redundant code and remove it. 
6. Make regression tests for all new features.
7. Be UX-oriented, always make sure that the user experience is the best possible. Test UX, look for improvements. 
8. If you see that your actions are resulting in a suboptimal solution or broken code, always look for a better way to implement the feature. Never implement a feature that is not optimal or does not work. 
Try to understand the wide context of your actions - not only the immediate task, but also the long-term goals of the project. Always think if your proposed solution aligns with the project's goals and vision.
